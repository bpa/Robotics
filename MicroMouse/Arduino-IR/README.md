drive and lib items are part of a fun but likely out of scope simulator

Link the FreeSans.ttf here so the current dumb ttf font open works
    ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf .

You will need SDL2::Raw, Cairo, and Algorithm::MinMaxHeap modules from perl6

    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

run with `perl6 drive`
